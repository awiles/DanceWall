# DanceWall

Welcome to DanceWall.  This software captures video from a webcam and manipulates with different computer vision algorithms to create a fun effect for kids to dance to.  The effects include basic thresholding, edge detection, image warping, Haar detectors, other motion detectors.  

Future work would include response to audio and other fun things.

## Hardware Requirements

To make this work you need:
* A webcam -- you can use your pre-installed webcam or a USB version.
* A projector -- I connect a projector via HDMI and project onto a white wall.  But you can also just use your monitor and a built in webcam as well.

## Build Instructions

To build this you need various open source libraries, which can be conveniently built using [openExternals](https://github.com/awiles/openExternals).  Note: openExternals is dependent on Qt 5.2.1 which needs to be installed ahead of time.

TODO: Add detailed build instructions for Windows & Mac.
